## Correlation Between Particulate Matter(PM2.5) and Coal-fired Plant Operation Using Public Participation Air Quality Sensing Data

### Abstract

Environmental problems such as carbon emissions and air pollution caused by coal-fired power plants are frequently subjected to public and scientific attention. Air pollution from fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is especially serious due to the high level of risk it presents to human health and the climate. Airbox is a device developed by Academia Sinica to allow the general public to monitor ambient air quality and enhance public engagement in air quality sensing. This paper uses Airbox air monitoring data from 2017 to perform panel data analysis to find the correlation between air pollution and coal-fired power plant operations. The analysis shows that PM2.5 concentration at monitoring points is positively correlated with the operating capacity and the previous-day capacity change of the nearest coal-fired power plant. The result also shows that PM2.5 concentration is positively correlated with wind speed at the monitoring points and negatively correlated with distance from monitoring points.
